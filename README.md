# loyalty-app-showcase
Showcase repository for my customer loyalty mobile app.

The aim was to create a digital ecosystem through which small businesses can reward consumers, increasing satisfaction and loyalty of customers while promoting local enterprises.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React Native, Node.js).

This project served as my graduation thesis.
